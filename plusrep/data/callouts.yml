selfvoters:
  - Upvoting yourself? Really {0}? That's just sad.
  - Stop! You have violated the law {0}! Pay the leaderboard a fine or serve your sentence. Your fraudulent votes are now forfeit. 
  - I'm sorry, but, did you really just upvote yourself {0}? For shame.
  - You know I ignore people who vote for themselves, right {0}?
  - Better stop while you're ahead {0}. It would be pretty embarrassing if someone called you out on the fact that you've been upvoting your own posts.
  - So today we learned {0} is the type of person who upvotes their own  posts. Good to know.
  - Wow, {0}, you really thought you could get away with upvoting your own post? Tsk tsk I'm always watching.
  - Let the record reflect that {0} upvotes their own posts and also probably cheats at solitaire.
  - Upvoting yourself again eh, {0}? Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.
  - Hey {0}, you know you are supposed to upvote using your alt instead of your main right?
  - It would appear as though {0} is laughing at their own joke.
  - I can't tell if {0} is upvoting their own post, or if they just click everything on the screen.
