selfvoters:
  - Upvoting yourself? Really {0}? That's just sad.
  - Stop! You have violated the law {0}! Pay the leaderboard a fine or serve your sentence. Your fraudulent votes are now forfeit. 
  - I'm sorry, but, did you really just upvote yourself {0}? For shame.
  - You know I ignore people who vote for themselves, right?
  - Better stop while you're ahead {0}. It would be pretty embarrassing if someone called you out on the fact that you've been upvoting your own posts.
