## Overview

These are miscellaneous cogs lacking any specific group or organization I've made for myself. 

| Cog         | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| notekeeper  | An organizational cog for keeping notes                      |
| breenreacts | Neil Breen will react to your messages                       |
| topmoji     | Counts how many times your guild's custom emotes are used and provides a ranking of the emotes based on their usage |

## Setup

### Redbot:

Setup for your redbot V3 instance is a straightforward process. 

1. Add this repo/branch with `[p]repo add crosseds-cogs https://github.com/crossedfall/crossed-cogs misc/master`
2. Install the cogs you want to use with `[p]cog install crosseds-cogs [cogname]`
3. Load your new cogs with `[p]load status [cogname]`

_Any reference to [p] should be replaced with your prefix, [cogname] should be replaced with the cog you want to install_

### Contact:
